A few days ago the Mue Team set out a goal which was to revamp the website. Whilst the old one was ok, we felt it was time for a refresh. We wanted something true to the Mue brand while remaining extremely fast and responsive.
To stick with our branding we made sure to use the exact same colours as used in our logo, the gradient and the white. This explains most of the website design choices. We also stuck with the font we knew, Lexend Deca. This is our favourite font due its simplicity and ease of access. We kept the main and best parts of the original website, such as the demo, while giving it a better overall feel.

I hope you enjoy this update to the website.
