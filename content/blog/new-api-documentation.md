Today I am happy to announce that the new Mue API documentation has launched! It's mostly similar to the old one, but now it's cleaner, faster and has no tracking. 

We've switched from [GitBook](https://gitbook.com/) to [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/), and you can find the documentation source in the Mue API GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/mue/api/tree/main/docs). The website URL is the same as before: [apidocs.muetab.com](https://apidocs.muetab.com).

If you find any problems, please let us know by opening an issue on the API repository!
