We're excited to launch the official Mue blog! This space will be your go-to source for product updates, technical deep-dives, and stories from our community of mindful makers.

## What to Expect

The Mue blog will feature:

- **Product Updates**: Stay informed about new features, improvements, and upcoming releases
- **Technical Deep-Dives**: Behind-the-scenes looks at how we build Mue and solve interesting technical challenges
- **Community Stories**: Highlights from our contributors and how they use Mue in their daily workflows
- **Best Practices**: Tips and tricks for getting the most out of Mue

## Our Mission

Since 2016, Mue has been helping people create calmer, more intentional browsing experiences. Every time you open a new tab, Mue greets you with beautiful visuals, meaningful quotes, and the tools you need to stay focused.

This blog is an extension of that mission—a place to share knowledge, build community, and help you make the most of your time online.

## Join the Conversation

We'd love to hear from you! If you have ideas for blog posts, feedback on our content, or stories to share about how you use Mue, reach out to us on [GitHub](https://github.com/mue/mue) or join our community discussions.
