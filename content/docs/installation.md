## Local
Installing Mue locally is a little more tricky. On Chromium based browsers, you can visit the extensions page (this is normally accessible through ``<browsername>://extensions``, e.g ``edge://extensions``)
or through the browser dropdown. Then, check the "Developer Mode" toggle. Next, you'll need to download a copy of Mue from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mue/mue/releases) and drag the downloaded .ZIP
file onto the extensions page. You can then open a new tab to start using Mue. If prompted with a question asking whether or not you want to accept the new tab changes, click yes.
